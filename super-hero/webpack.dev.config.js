/**
 * TYPE RESOURCES
 * - asset/resource: generates the file and add an URL to the resource
 * - asset/inline: generate a base64 enconded in the place where the resource is used
 * - asset: webpack will decide it automatically; less than 8Kb the resource is going to be treated
 *          as asset/inline, otherwise it will be treated as asset/resource.
 *          It accepts an option to determine the size of the file
 *          parser: {
 *            dataUrlCondition: { maxSize: 3 * 1024; // 3 kilobytes }
 *          }
 */

/**
 * LOADERS
 * - There are some loaders that came with webpack, other ones need to be installed as a devDependency
